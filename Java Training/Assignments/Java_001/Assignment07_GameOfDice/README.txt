This program pits you against the computer.
Using the same 2-d array from the previous assignment, along with
the random function in other assignments, you will play a dice roll game
with the computer. After you both roll and the totals are added up, 
a winner is determined depending on either the sums or the combinations 
that were rolled, or both.
