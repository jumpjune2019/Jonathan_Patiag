This program takes things from previous assignments
in this root folder and combines, such as the custom exception
for blank entries and options to print from files.
This program takes in a name, number, and address and adds it to an array
via a loop that loops 5 times. After the loop runs 5 rounds, the
option to print is given again to print to file/screen/both.
